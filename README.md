Title: Class imbalance in gradient boosting classification algorithms: application to experimental stroke data

Abstract:

Imbalance between positive and negative outcomes, a so-called class imbalance, is a problem generally
found in medical data. Imbalanced data hinders the performance of conventional classification
methods which aim to improve the overall accuracy of the model without accounting for uneven
distribution of the classes. To rectify this, the data can be resampled by oversampling the positive
(minority) class until the classes are approximately equally represented. After that a prediction model
such as Gradient Boosting algorithm can be fitted with greater confidence. This classification method
allows for non-linear relationships and deep interactive effects while focusing on difficult areas by
iterative shifting towards problematic observations. In this study we demonstrate application of these
methods to medical data and develop a practical framework for evaluation of features contributing
into the probability of stroke.
